        <p style="text-align:center; font-size:30px; color:white;">
        The American Council of the Blind (ACB) was founded in 1961 but many of its state affiliates and local chapters have a history that can be traced back to the 1880s. Since its inception, ACB and its affiliates have been at the forefront in advocating for programs and policies that have created the opportunities blind and visually impaired Americans now enjoy.  The American Council of the Blind believes in the acceptance of all blind persons irrespective of where they are in their adjustment to blindness.  We value every person for their individual strengths, abilities, and accomplishments, and we look forward to seeing ACB Link serve as a further vehicle of communication and interaction among all members of the ACB community and among those with questions and concerns about sight loss.</p>
