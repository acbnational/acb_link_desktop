Say your configured wake word (default: \"Hey Link\") and wait for the listening indicator sound. Then speak your command.

> **Note:** Wake word detection requires optional AI/ML components (~5GB) that are not included in the standard installer. See \"Installing Wake Word Support\" below for setup instructions.

**Continuous Mode:**
If you disable the wake word requirement in Settings, you can speak commands continuously without saying the wake word first.

### Installing Wake Word Support (Optional)\n\nThe wake word feature allows hands-free activation by saying a phrase like \"Hey ACB Link\". This requires additional AI/ML libraries that are downloaded separately to keep the main installer small.\n\n**To install wake word support:**\n\n1. Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS)\n2. Run: `pip install openwakeword torch torchaudio`\n3. Wait for download to complete (~5GB, may take several minutes)\n4. Restart ACB Link Desktop\n5. Go to Settings > Voice Control to configure your wake word\n\n**Without wake word support**, voice control still works fully:\n- Press `Ctrl+Shift+V` to activate voice listening\n- Speak your command\n- All voice commands function normally\n\nThe only difference is you activate by keyboard instead of by speaking a wake phrase.

## System Tray

### Tray Icon

ACB Link places an icon in your system tray, also called the notification area. This allows quick access while the main window is minimized or hidden.

### Tray Menu Options

Right-click the tray icon to access:

- Show or Hide Window
- Play or Pause
- Stop
- Streams submenu (quick stream switching)
- Start or Stop Recording
- Settings
- Exit ACB Link

### Tray Icon Click Behavior

You can customize what happens when you click the tray icon:

**Double-click action** (choose one):
- Show or hide window (default)
- Play or pause playback

**Single-click action** (choose one):
- No action (default)
- Show or hide window
- Play or pause playback
- Show the tray menu

Configure these in Settings under System Tray.

### Minimize to Tray

When enabled, minimizing the window hides it completely to the system tray instead of keeping it in the taskbar. This keeps your taskbar clean while ACB Link plays in the background.

### Close to Tray

When enabled, clicking the X button hides ACB Link to the tray instead of quitting the application. To fully exit, right-click the tray icon and select Exit.

### Start Minimized to Tray

Launch ACB Link completely hidden in the system tray. The window won't appear at all - perfect for having ACB Link start automatically with Windows and play in the background.

To enable: Settings, System Tray tab, check "Start minimized to tray"

### Tray Notifications

ACB Link can show balloon notifications from the system tray:

- Now playing notifications when streams change
- Recording status notifications
- Event reminders
- Update available alerts

Configure notification types and duration in Settings under System Tray or Notifications.

## Announcements

### Overview

ACB Link keeps you informed with important announcements, updates, and alerts. The announcement system ensures you never miss critical information while letting you control how and when you receive notifications.

### Announcement Widget

When you have unread announcements, a widget appears at the top of your home page:

- Shows unread announcements with priority indicators
- Critical announcements show a red alert icon
- High-priority announcements show an exclamation mark
- Click any announcement to read the full details
- Use "Mark All Read" to clear all announcements
- Use "View All" to see announcement history

The widget only appears when there are unread announcements. Once you have read all announcements, it hides automatically.

### Priority Levels

| Priority | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| Critical | Urgent - requires immediate attention (security, outages) |
| High | Important information you should read soon |
| Normal | Standard announcements and updates |
| Low | Minor updates and tips |
| Info | General information |

### Viewing Announcements

There are several ways to view announcements:

1. **Home Widget**: Click announcements directly from the home page
2. **Help Menu**: Go to Help, then Announcements (Control plus Shift plus A)

### Announcement History

4. Click "Check for New" to fetch latest announcements
5. Select any announcement and press Enter or click View

### Critical Announcements

When a critical announcement arrives, ACB Link will:

1. Show a popup dialog that you must acknowledge
2. Display a native notification on your desktop
3. Play a sound alert (if enabled)

Critical announcements cannot be dismissed without acknowledgment. This ensures you see important security alerts, service outages, or urgent updates.

### Native Notifications

ACB Link uses your operating system's notification system:

**On Windows**: Toast notifications appear in the corner and Action Center
**On macOS**: Notifications appear in Notification Center

You can configure:
- Which priority levels trigger notifications
- Whether to play sounds
- Whether critical announcements show popups

### Announcement Settings

To configure announcements, go to Settings and select the Announcements tab:

| Check interval | How often to check (in minutes, 0 for manual only) |
